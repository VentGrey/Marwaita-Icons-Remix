## Description :pencil:

Icon pack for linux based on Darkomarko42 awesome marwaita icons. 

This is a "remix" or revival of the popular Marwaita Icon theme made by [Darkomarko42](https://github.com/darkomarko42) which is what I consider one of the
very few icon themes that look awesome on Budgie. Unfortunately this icon theme got discontinued a long time ago. 

This icon pack pretends to revive his work by mixing the current [Luna Icons](https://www.pling.com/p/1405455/) and [Marwaita OSX](https://www.pling.com/p/1374624/) icons
to be as close as possible to the original work of Darkomarko42 in the current icon-remix. 

## Disclaimer :warning:

I only pasted the icons together and cherrypicked other ones, no special work was done here. If you wish to support this icon theme, please do so by supporting
the original creator of the former.
